# Automatic_ETL_Weather_data
This repository contains files for ETL weather data from wttr.in website and store it in tabular format 
* In this project, I am creating tabular data on one city's current temperature and future afternoon temperature and storing it as year month date, and hour values.
* Created shell script and automated the entry from the website daily by CRONTAB
